Classproject: A Time-Series Analysis to Investigate the Weekly Variations in Satellite-Derived NO2 Column Amount

Daily Level-3 satellite data for 2020 were processed using the popy framework. 
NetCDF files were read at 0.02° spatial resolution over the CONUS domain, and key variables including NO₂ column amount. 
The dataset was aggregated temporally to compute mean fields, which were then used for analyses.
